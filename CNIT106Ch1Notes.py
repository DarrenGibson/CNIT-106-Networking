Chapter Summary Questions

1.  Which of the folllowing provides the media ( wired or wireless) to facilitate the 
transfer of data?

a. Server
b. LAN 
c. Client
d. Router

	b. The local arra network (LAN) consists of many different components.
	One critical aspect is the media (wired or wireless) that can transmit the 
	data from node to node 

2.  Which device makes traffic-forwarding decisions based of MAC addresses? 

a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Multiplexer

	c. Switches forward traffic based on the sedtination MAC (hardware)
	address contained in the data frame.  Contrast this to a router, which
	makes forwarding decidiond based on the sedtination IP address 

3. A company has a various locations in a city interconnected using Metro Ether-
net connections. This is an example of what type of network?

a.
b.
c.
d.

	d. The metropolitan area network is superb for connecting various build-
	ings in a citywide area. Metro Etherenet is one example of connectivity
	techology for the design.

4. A network formed by interconnecting a PC to a digital camera via a USB cable 
is considered what type of network?

a. WAN
b. CAN
c. PAN
d. MAN

	c. The personal area network features fewer nodes than typically found in
	a LAN. This design also features a dmall geographic area, such as a car or 
	a single room office. 

5.  Which of the following physical LAN topologies requires the most cabling?

a. Bus 
b. Ring
c. Star
d. WLAN

	c. The star topology is common today in switched LAN's. However, it 
	does feature quite a bit of cabling, as the switched require media to each
	and every node (wired) that needs to communicate.  There are also typi-
	cally trunk connections between the switched for an extended star topol-
	ogy, which requires even more cabling 

6. Which of the followoing topologies offers the highest level of redundancy

a. Full mesh
b. Hub and spoke 
c. Bus 
d. Partial mesh

	a. The full-mesh topology might be complex and expensive to implement, 
	but it does provide excellent levels of redundancy. Should one or more 
	links fail, it is often possible to reroute traffic around the failures.	
	
how many wan loinks are required to creat a full mesh of connections 
between fice remote sites?

a. 5
b. 10
c. 15
d. 20 

	b. Remember, the formula for the number of connections required for the 
	full-mesh topology is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of nodes.  So, in this 
	case, 5(5-1)/2 is 10

8. Indentify two advantages of a hub-and-spoke WAN topology as compared to a 
full-mesh WAN topology

a. Lower cost
b. Optimal routes 
c. More scalable 
d. More redundancy

	a, c. THE hub and spoke is actually a form of a partial-mesh topology.
	This topology has the advantage of being less complex, less costly, and 
	overall more scalable than a full-mesh design.

9. Which type of network is based on network clients sharing resources with one
another?

a. Client/Server
b. Client-peer
c. Peer to peer
d. Peer to server

	c. The peer to peer (P2P) network features clients sharing information
	directly with each other.  

10. Which of the following is an advantage of a peer-to-peer network, as comp-
pared with a client/server network?

a. More scalable 
b. Less Expansive 
c. Better Performance
d. Simplified administration 

	The P2P network is often celebrated due to its simplicity and low cost.
	Unfortunately, it is not scalble and can actually cause administration night-
	mares when attempting to scale it.

11. What type of wireless topology features the use of access points to facilitate 
network communications?

a. Ad Hoc 
b. Mesh
c. Infrastructure 
d. Ring

	c. The infrastructure type of topology features specialized nodes (access 
	points) that permit commucnications between other nodes.

12. What network type would help facilitate communications when large video or 
audio files need to be housed and transfered through the network?

a. WLAN
b. CAN
c. PAN
d. SAN

	d. The storage area network (SAN) assists when large amounts of data must be
	stored in the network and transfered efficiently from various nodes to other 
	nodes.
